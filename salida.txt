in computer science  a data strucuture is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently different kinds of data strucutures are suited to different kinds of applications  and some are highly specialized to specific tasks  for example  b trees are particularly well suited for implementation of databases  while compiler implementations usually use hash tables to look up identifiers data structures provide a means to manage huge amounts of data eficiently  such as large databases and internet indexing services  usually  efficient data structures are a key to designing efficient algorithms  some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data strucutures  rather than algorithms  as the key organizing factor in software design
