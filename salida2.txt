origin of species introduction when on board h m s  beagle  as naturalist  i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the organic beings inhabiting south america  and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that continent  these facts  as will be seen in the latter chapters of this volume  seemed to throw some light on the origin of species  that mystery of mysteries  as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers  on my return home  it occurred to me in 1837  that something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing on it  after five years  work i allowed myself to speculate on the subject  and drew up some short notes  these i enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions  which then seemed to me probable: from that period to the present day i have steadily pursued the same object  i hope that i may be excused for entering on these personal details  as i give them to show that i have not been hasty in coming to a decision my work is now  1859  nearly finished  but as it will take me many more years to complete it  and as my health is far from strong  i have been urged to publish this abstract  i have more especially been induced to do this  as mr  wallace  who is now studying the natural history of the malay archipelago  has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that i have on the origin of species  in 1858 he sent me a memoir on this subject  with a request that i would forward it to sir charles lyell  who sent it to the linnean society  and it is published in the third volume of the journal of that society  sir c  lyell and dr hooker  who both knew of my work  the latter having read my sketch of 1844  honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish  with mr wallace s excellent memoir  some brief extracts from my manuscripts this abstract  which i now publish  must necessarily be imperfect  i cannot here give references and authorities for my several statements and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy no doubt errors may have crept in  though i hope i have always been cautious in trusting to good authorities alone  i can here give only the general conclusions at which i have arrived  with a few facts in illustration  but which  i hope  in most cases will suffice  no one can feel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts  with references  on which my conclusions have been grounded  and i hope in a future work to do this  for i am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot be adduced  often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which i have arrived  a fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on both sides of each question  and this is here impossible i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from very many naturalists  some of them personally unknown to me  i cannot however  let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep obligations to dr  hooker  who  for the last fifteen years  has aided me in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment in considering the origin of species  it is quite conceivable that a naturalist  reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations  their geographical distribution geological succession  and other such facts  might come to the conclusion that species had not been independently created  but had descended  like varieties  from other species  nevertheless  such a conclusion  even if well founded  would be unsatisfactory  until it could be shown how the innumerable species  inhabiting this world have been modified  so as to acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which justly excites our admiration  naturalists continually refer to external conditions  such as climate  food  etc as the only possible cause of variation  in one limited sense  as we shall hereafter see  this may be true  but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions  the structure  for instance of the woodpecker  with its feet  tail  beak  and tongue  so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees  in the case of the mistletoe  which draws its nourishment from certain trees  which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds  and which has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other  it is equally preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite  with its relations to several distinct organic beings  by the effects of external conditions or of habit  or of the volition of the plant itself it is  therefore  of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the means of modification and coadaptation  at the commencement of my observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out this obscure problem  nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found that our knowledge  imperfect though it be  of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clue  i may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such studies  although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists from these considerations  i shall devote the first chapter of this abstract to variation under domestication  we shall thus see that a large amount of hereditary modification is at least possible  and  what is equally or more important  we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his selection successive slight variations  i will then pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature  but i shall  unfortunately  be compelled to treat this subject far too briefly  as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues of facts  we shall  however  be enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation  in the next chapter the struggle for existence among all organic beings throughout the world  which inevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of their increase will be considered  this is the doctrine of malthus  applied to the whole animal and vegetable kingdoms  as many more individuals of each species are born than can possibly survive  and as  consequently  there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence  it follows that any being  if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself under the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life  will have a better chance of surviving  and thus be naturally selected  from the strong principle of inheritance  any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and modified form this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated at some length in the fourth chapter  and we shall then see how natural selection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improved forms of life  and leads to what i have called divergence of character in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws of variation  in the five succeeding chapters  the most apparent and gravest difficulties in accepting the theory will be given: namely first  the difficulties of transitions  or how a simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed being or into an elaborately constructed organ  secondly the subject of instinct  or the mental powers of animals  thirdly  hybridism  or the infertility of species and the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and fourthly  the imperfection of the geological record  in the next chapter i shall consider the geological succession of organic beings throughout time  in the twelfth and thirteenth  their geographical distribution throughout space  in the fourteenth  their classification or mutual affinities  both when mature and in an embryonic condition  in the last chapter i shall give a brief recapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard to the origin of species and varieties  if he make due allowance for our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of the many beings which live around us  who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very numerous  and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and  as i believe  the future success and modification of every inhabitant of this world  still less do we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past geological epochs in its history  although much remains obscure  and will long remain obscure  i can entertain no doubt  after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment of which i am capable  that the view which most naturalists until recently entertained  and which i formerly entertained  namely  that each species has been independently created  is erroneous  i am fully convinced that species are not immutable  but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species  in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any one species are the descendants of that species  furthermore  i am convinced that natural selection has been the most important  but not the exclusive  means of modification chapter i  variation under domestication  causes of variability  effects of habit and the use and disuse of  parts  correlated variation  inheritance  character of domestic  varieties  difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and  species  origin of domestic varieties from one or more species  domestic  pigeons  their differences and origin  principles of selection  anciently followed  their effects  methodical and unconscious  selection  unknown origin of our domestic productions  circumstances  favourable to man s power of selection causes of variability when we compare the individuals of the same variety or sub variety of our older cultivated plants and animals  one of the first points which strikes us is  that they generally differ more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature  and if we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been cultivated  and which have varied during all ages under the most different climates and treatment  we are driven to conclude that this great variability is due to our domestic productions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniform as  and somewhat different from those to which the parent species had been exposed under nature  there is  also  some probability in the view propounded by andrew knight  that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food  it seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation  and that  when the organisation has once begun to vary  it generally continues varying for many generations  no case is on record of a variable organism ceasing to vary under cultivation  our oldest cultivated plants  such as wheat  still yield new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid improvement or modification as far as i am able to judge  after long attending to the subject  the conditions of life appear to act in two ways  directly on the whole organisation or on certain parts alone and in directly by affecting the reproductive system  with respect to the direct action  we must bear in mind that in every case  as professor weismann has lately insisted and as i have incidently shown in my work on  variation under domestication   there are two factors: namely  the nature of the organism and the nature of the conditions  the former seems to be much the more important  for nearly similar variations sometimes arise under as far as we can judge  dissimilar conditions  and  on the other hand dissimilar variations arise under conditions which appear to be nearly uniform  the effects on the offspring are either definite or in definite  they may be considered as definite when all or nearly all the offspring of individuals exposed to certain conditions during several generations are modified in the same manner  it is extremely difficult to come to any conclusion in regard to the extent of the changes which have been thus definitely induced  there can  however  be little doubt about many slight changes  such as size from the amount of food colour from the nature of the food  thickness of the skin and hair from climate  etc  each of the endless variations which we see in the plumage of our fowls must have had some efficient cause  and if the same cause were to act uniformly during a long series of generations on many individuals  all probably would be modified in the same manner  such facts as the complex and extraordinary out growths which variably follow from the insertion of a minute drop of poison by a gall producing insect  shows us what singular modifications might result in the case of plants from a chemical change in the nature of the sap in definite variability is a much more common result of changed conditions than definite variability  and has probably played a more important part in the formation of our domestic races  we see in definite variability in the endless slight peculiarities which distinguish the individuals of the same species  and which cannot be accounted for by inheritance from either parent or from some more remote ancestor  even strongly marked differences occasionally appear in the young of the same litter  and in seedlings from the same seed capsule at long intervals of time  out of millions of individuals reared in the same country and fed on nearly the same food  deviations of structure so strongly pronounced as to deserve to be called monstrosities arise  but monstrosities cannot be separated by any distinct line from slighter variations  all such changes of structure  whether extremely slight or strongly marked  which appear among many individuals living together may be considered as the in definite effects of the conditions of life on each individual organism  in nearly the same manner as the chill effects different men in an in definite manner  according to their state of body or constitution  causing coughs or colds  rheumatism  or inflammation of various organs with respect to what i have called the in direct action of changed conditions  namely  through the reproductive system of being affected we may infer that variability is thus induced  partly from the fact of this system being extremely sensitive to any change in the conditions and partly from the similarity  as kolreuter and others have remarked between the variability which follows from the crossing of distinct species  and that which may be observed with plants and animals when reared under new or unnatural conditions  many facts clearly show how eminently susceptible the reproductive system is to very slight changes in the surrounding conditions  nothing is more easy than to tame an animal  and few things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement  even when the male and female unite  how many animals there are which will not breed  though kept in an almost free state in their native country! this is generally  but erroneously attributed to vitiated instincts  many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour and yet rarely or never seed! in some few cases it has been discovered that a very trifling change  such as a little more or less water at some particular period of growth  will determine whether or not a plant will produce seeds  i cannot here give the details which i have collected and elsewhere published on this curious subject  but to show how singular the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement  i may mention that carnivorous animals  even from the tropics  breed in this country pretty freely under confinement  with the exception of the plantigrades or bear family  which seldom produce young  whereas  carnivorous birds  with the rarest exception  hardly ever lay fertile eggs  many exotic plants have pollen utterly worthless in the same condition as in the most sterile hybrids  when  on the one hand  we see domesticated animals and plants  though often weak and sickly  breeding freely under confinement  and when  on the other hand we see individuals  though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed  long lived  and healthy  of which i could give numerous instances   yet having their reproductive system so seriously affected by unperceived causes as to fail to act  we need not be surprised at this system  when it does act under confinement  acting irregularly and producing offspring somewhat unlike their parents  i may add that as some organisms breed freely under the most unnatural conditions  for instance  rabbits and ferrets kept in hutches  showing that their reproductive organs are not easily affected  so will some animals and plants withstand domestication or cultivation  and vary very slightly  perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature some naturalists have maintained that all variations are connected with the act of sexual reproduction  but this is certainly an error  for i have given in another work a long list of  sporting plants   as they are called by gardeners  that is  of plants which have suddenly produced a single bud with a new and sometimes widely different character from that of the other buds on the same plant  these bud variations  as they may be named  can be propagated by grafts  offsets  etc   and sometimes by seed  they occur rarely under nature  but are far from rare under culture  as a single bud out of many thousands produced year after year on the same tree under uniform conditions  has been known suddenly to assume a new character  and as buds on distinct trees  growing under different conditions  have sometimes yielded nearly the same variety  for instance  buds on peach trees producing nectarines  and buds on common roses producing moss roses  we clearly see that the nature of the conditions is of subordinate importance in comparison with the nature of the organism in determining each particular form of variation  perhaps of not more importance than the nature of the spark by which a mass of combustible matter is ignited  has in determining the nature of the flames effects of habit and of the use or disuse of parts  correlated variation  inheritance changed habits produce an inherited effect as in the period of the flowering of plants when transported from one climate to another  with animals the increased use or disuse of parts has had a more marked influence  thus i find in the domestic duck that the bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more  in proportion to the whole skeleton  than do the same bones in the wild duck  and this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less  and walking more  than its wild parents  the great and inherited development of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually milked in comparison with these organs in other countries  is probably another instance of the effects of use  not one of our domestic animals can be named which has not in some country drooping ears  and the view which has been suggested that the drooping is due to disuse of the muscles of the ear  from the animals being seldom much alarmed  seems probable many laws regulate variation  some few of which can be dimly seen  and will hereafter be briefly discussed  i will here only allude to what may be called correlated variation  important changes in the embryo or larva will probably entail changes in the mature animal  in monstrosities the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious  and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st  hilaire s great work on this subject  breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by an elongated head  some instances of correlation are quite whimsical thus cats which are entirely white and have blue eyes are generally deaf  but it has been lately stated by mr  tait that this is confined to the males  colour and constitutional peculiarities go together  of which many remarkable cases could be given among animals and plants  from facts collected by heusinger  it appears that white sheep and pigs are injured by certain plants  while dark coloured individuals escape: professor wyman has recently communicated to me a good illustration of this fact  on asking some farmers in virginia how it was that all their pigs were black  they informed him that the pigs ate the paint root  lachnanthes   which coloured their bones pink  and which caused the hoofs of all but the black varieties to drop off  and one of the  crackers   i e  virginia squatters  added   we select the black members of a litter for raising  as they alone have a good chance of living hairless dogs have imperfect teeth  long haired and coarse haired animals are apt to have  as is asserted  long or many horns  pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes  pigeons with short beaks have small feet  and those with long beaks large feet  hence if man goes on selecting  and thus augmenting  any peculiarity  he will almost certainly modify unintentionally other parts of the structure owing to the mysterious laws of correlation the results of the various  unknown  or but dimly understood laws of variation are infinitely complex and diversified  it is well worth while carefully to study the several treatises on some of our old cultivated plants  as on the hyacinth  potato  even the dahlia  etc   and it is really surprising to note the endless points of structure and constitution in which the varieties and sub varieties differ slightly from each other  the whole organisation seems to have become plastic and departs in a slight degree from that of the parental type any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us  but the number and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure  both those of slight and those of considerable physiological importance are endless  dr  prosper lucas  treatise  in two large volumes  is the fullest and the best on this subject  no breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance  that like produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this principle only by theoretical writers  when any deviation of structure often appears  and we see it in the father and child  we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same cause having acted on both  but when among individuals  apparently exposed to the same conditions  any very rare deviation  due to some extraordinary combination of circumstances  appears in the parent  say once among several million individuals  and it reappears in the child  the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to inheritance  every one must have heard of cases of albinism  prickly skin  hairy bodies  etc   appearing in several members of the same family  if strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited  less strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable  perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject would be  to look at the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule  and non inheritance as the anomaly the laws governing inheritance are for the most part unknown  no one can say why the same peculiarity in different individuals of the same species  or in different species  is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so  why the child often reverts in certain characteristics to its grandfather or grandmother or more remote ancestor  why a peculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes  or to one sex alone more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex  it is a fact of some importance to us  that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted  either exclusively or in a much greater degree  to the males alone  a much more important rule  which i think may be trusted  is that  at whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears  it tends to reappear in the offspring at a corresponding age  though sometimes earlier  in many cases this could not be otherwise  thus the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearly mature  peculiarities in the silk worm are known to appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage  but hereditary diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension  and that  when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity should appear at any particular age  yet that it does tend to appear in the offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent  i believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of embryology  these remarks are of course confined to the first appearance of the peculiarity  and not to the primary cause which may have acted on the ovules or on the male element  in nearly the same manner as the increased length of the horns in the offspring from a short horned cow by a long horned bull  though appearing late in life  is clearly due to the male element having alluded to the subject of reversion  i may here refer to a statement often made by naturalists  namely  that our domestic varieties  when run wild  gradually but invariably revert in character to their aboriginal stocks  hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature  i have in vain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so boldly been made  there would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wild state  in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was  and so could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued  it would be necessary  in order to prevent the effects of intercrossing  that only a single variety should be turned loose in its new home  nevertheless  as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of their characters to ancestral forms  it seems to me not improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising  or were to cultivate  during many generations  the several races  for instance of the cabbage  in very poor soil  in which case  however  some effect would have to be attributed to the definite action of the poor soil  that they would  to a large extent  or even wholly  revert to the wild aboriginal stock  whether or not the experiment would succeed is not of great importance for our line of argument  for by the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed  if it could be shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion  that is to lose their acquired characters  while kept under the same conditions and while kept in a considerable body  so that free intercrossing might check  by blending together  any slight deviations in their structure in such case  i grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic varieties in regard to species  but there is not a shadow of evidence in favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and race horses  long and short horned cattle  and poultry of various breeds  and esculent vegetables  for an unlimited number of generations would be opposed to all experience character of domestic varieties  difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species  origin of domestic varieties from one or more species when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and plants  and compare them with closely allied species  we generally perceive in each domestic race  as already remarked  less uniformity of character than in true species  domestic races often have a somewhat monstrous character  by which i mean  that  although differing from each other and from other species of the same genus  in several trifling respects  they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part  both when compared one with another  and more especially when compared with the species under nature to which they are nearest allied  with these exceptions  and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed  a subject hereafter to be discussed   domestic races of the same species differ from each other in the same manner as do the closely allied species of the same genus in a state of nature but the differences in most cases are less in degree  this must be admitted as true  for the domestic races of many animals and plants have been ranked by some competent judges as the descendants of aboriginally distinct species  and by other competent judges as mere varieties if any well marked distinction existed between a domestic race and a species  this source of doubt would not so perpetually recur  it has often been stated that domestic races do not differ from each other in characters of generic value  it can be shown that this statement is not correct  but naturalists differ much in determining what characters are of generic value  all such valuations being at present empirical  when it is explained how genera originate under nature  it will be seen that we have no right to expect often to find a generic amount of difference in our domesticated races in attempting to estimate the amount of structural difference between allied domestic races  we are soon involved in doubt  from not knowing whether they are descended from one or several parent species  this point  if it could be cleared up  would be interesting  if  for instance  it could be shown that the greyhound  bloodhound  terrier spaniel and bull dog  which we all know propagate their kind truly  were the offspring of any single species  then such facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of the many closely allied natural species  for instance  of the many foxes  inhabiting the different quarters of the world  i do not believe  as we shall presently see  that the whole amount of difference between the several breeds of the dog has been produced under domestication  i believe that a small part of the difference is due to their being descended from distinct species  in the case of strongly marked races of some other domesticated species  there is presumptive or even strong evidence that all are descended from a single wild stock it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary  and likewise to withstand diverse climates  i do not dispute that these capacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions  but how could a savage possibly know  when he first tamed an animal  whether it would vary in succeeding generations  and whether it would endure other climates? has the little variability of the ass and goose  or the small power of endurance of warmth by the reindeer or of cold by the common camel  prevented their domestication? i cannot doubt that if other animals and plants  equal in number to our domesticated productions  and belonging to equally diverse classes and countries  were taken from a state of nature  and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under domestication  they would on an average vary as largely as the parent species of our existing domesticated productions have varied in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants it is not possible to come to any definite conclusion  whether they are descended from one or several wild species  the argument mainly relied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domestic animals is  that we find in the most ancient times  on the monuments of egypt and in the lake habitations of switzerland  much diversity in the breeds  and that some of these ancient breeds closely resemble  or are even identical with  those still existing  but this only throws far backward the history of civilization  and shows that animals were domesticated at a much earlier period than has hitherto been supposed the lake inhabitants of switzerland cultivated several kinds of wheat and barley  the pea  the poppy for oil and flax  and they possessed several domesticated animals  they also carried on commerce with other nations  all this clearly shows  as her has remarked  that they had at this early age progressed considerably in civilization  and this again implies a long continued previous period of less advanced civilization during which the domesticated animals  kept by different tribes in different districts  might have varied and given rise to distinct races since the discovery of flint tools in the superficial formations of many parts of the world  all geologists believe that barbarian men existed at an enormously remote period  and we know that at the present day there is hardly a tribe so barbarous as not to have domesticated at least the dog the origin of most of our domestic animals will probably forever remain vague  but i may here state that  looking to the domestic dogs of the whole world  i have  after a laborious collection of all known facts come to the conclusion that several wild species of canidae have been tamed  and that their blood  in some cases mingled together  flows in the veins of our domestic breeds  in regard to sheep and goats i can form no decided opinion  from facts communicated to me by mr  blyth on the habits  voice  constitution and structure of the humped indian cattle  it is almost certain that they are descended from a different aboriginal stock from our european cattle  and some competent judges believe that these latter have had two or three wild progenitors whether or not these deserve to be called species  this conclusion  as well as that of the specific distinction between the humped and common cattle  may  indeed  be looked upon as established by the admirable researches of professor rutimeyer  with respect to horses  from reasons which i cannot here give  i am doubtfully inclined to believe  in opposition to several authors  that all the races belong to the same species  having kept nearly all the english breeds of the fowl alive having bred and crossed them  and examined their skeletons  it appears to me almost certain that all are the descendants of the wild indian fowl  gallus bankiva  and this is the conclusion of mr  blyth  and of others who have studied this bird in india  in regard to ducks and rabbits  some breeds of which differ much from each other  the evidence is clear that they are all descended from the common duck and wild rabbit the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks  has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors  they believe that every race which breeds true  let the distinctive characters be ever so slight  has had its wild prototype at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle  as many sheep  and several goats  in europe alone  and several even within great britain  one author believes that there formerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to great britain! when we bear in mind that britain has now not one peculiar mammal  and france but few distinct from those of germany  and so with hungary  spain etc   but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle  sheep  etc   we must admit that many domestic breeds must have originated in europe  for whence otherwise could they have been derived? so it is in india  even in the case of the breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world  which i admit are descended from several wild species  it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation  for who will believe that animals closely resembling the italian greyhound  the bloodhound  the bull dog pug dog  or blenheim spaniel  etc   so unlike all wild canidae  ever existed in a state of nature? it has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species  but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents  and if we account for our several domestic races by this process  we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms  as the italian greyhound  bloodhound  bull dog etc   in the wild state  moreover  the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated  many cases are on record showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired character  but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct races would be very difficult  sir j  sebright expressly experimented with this object and failed  the offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes  as i have found with pigeons  quite uniform in character  and every thing seems simple enough  but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations  hardly two of them are alike  and then the difficulty of the task becomes manifest breeds of the domestic pigeon  their differences and origin believing that it is always best to study some special group  i have after deliberation  taken up domestic pigeons  i have kept every breed which i could purchase or obtain  and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters of the world  more especially by the hon  w  elliot from india  and by the hon  c  murray from persia  many treatises in different languages have been published on pigeons  and some of them are very important  as being of considerable antiquity  i have associated with several eminent fanciers  and have been permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs  the diversity of the breeds is something astonishing  compare the english carrier and the short faced tumbler  and see the wonderful difference in their beaks  entailing corresponding differences in their skulls  the carrier  more especially the male bird  is also remarkable from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head  and this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids  very large external orifices to the nostrils  and a wide gape of mouth  the short faced tumbler has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch  and the common tumbler has the singular inherited habit of flying at a great height in a compact flock  and tumbling in the air head over heels  the runt is a bird of great size  with long massive beak and large feet  some of the sub breeds of runts have very long necks  others very long wings and tails  others singularly short tails  the barb is allied to the carrier  but  instead of a long beak has a very short and broad one  the pouter has a much elongated body wings  and legs  and its enormously developed crop  which it glories in inflating  may well excite astonishment and even laughter  the turbit has a short and conical beak  with a line of reversed feathers down the breast  and it has the habit of continually expanding  slightly  the upper part of the oesophagus  the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood  and it has  proportionally to its size  elongated wing and tail feathers  the trumpeter and laugher  as their names express  utter a very different coo from the other breeds  the fantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers  instead of twelve or fourteen  the normal number in all the members of the great pigeon family: these feathers are kept expanded and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail touch: the oil gland is quite aborted  several other less distinct breeds might be specified in the skeletons of the several breeds  the development of the bones of the face  in length and breadth and curvature  differs enormously  the shape  as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw varies in a highly remarkable manner  the caudal and sacral vertebrae vary in number  as does the number of the ribs  together with their relative breadth and the presence of processes  the size and shape of the apertures in the sternum are highly variable  so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula  the proportional width of the gape of mouth  the proportional length of the eyelids  of the orifice of the nostrils  of the tongue  not always in strict correlation with the length of beak   the size of the crop and of the upper part of the oesophagus  the development and abortion of the oil gland  the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers  the relative length of the wing and tail to each other and to the body the relative length of the leg and foot  the number of scutellae on the toes  the development of skin between the toes  are all points of structure which are variable  the period at which the perfect plumage is acquired varies  as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds are clothed when hatched  the shape and size of the eggs vary  the manner of flight  and in some breeds the voice and disposition  differ remarkably  lastly  in certain breeds  the males and females have come to differ in a slight degree from each other altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen  which  if shown to an ornithologist  and he were told that they were wild birds  would certainly be ranked by him as well defined species  moreover  i do not believe that any ornithologist would in this case place the english carrier  the short faced tumbler  the runt  the barb  pouter  and fantail in the same genus  more especially as in each of these breeds several truly inherited sub breeds  or species  as he would call them could be shown him great as are the differences between the breeds of the pigeon  i am fully convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct namely  that all are descended from the rock pigeon  columba livia including under this term several geographical races or sub species which differ from each other in the most trifling respects  as several of the reasons which have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases  i will here briefly give them  if the several breeds are not varieties  and have not proceeded from the rock pigeon they must have descended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks for it is impossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how  for instance  could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the parent stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have been rock pigeons  that is  they did not breed or willingly perch on trees  but besides c  livia  with its geographical sub species  only two or three other species of rock pigeons are known  and these have not any of the characters of the domestic breeds  hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated  and yet be unknown to ornithologists  and this  considering their size  habits and remarkable characters  seems improbable  or they must have become extinct in the wild state  but birds breeding on precipices  and good flyers  are unlikely to be exterminated  and the common rock pigeon  which has the same habits with the domestic breeds  has not been exterminated even on several of the smaller british islets  or on the shores of the mediterranean  hence the supposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock pigeon seems a very rash assumption  moreover  the several above named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world  and  therefore  some of them must have been carried back again into their native country  but not one has become wild or feral though the dovecot pigeon  which is the rock pigeon in a very slightly altered state  has become feral in several places  again  all recent experience shows that it is difficult to get wild animals to breed freely under domestication  yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons  it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times by half civilized man as to be quite prolific under confinement an argument of great weight  and applicable in several other cases  is that the above specified breeds  though agreeing generally with the wild rock pigeon in constitution  habits  voice  colouring  and in most parts of their structure  yet are certainly highly abnormal in other parts  we may look in vain through the whole great family of columbidae for a beak like that of the english carrier  or that of the short faced tumbler  or barb  for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin  for a crop like that of the pouter  for tail feathers like those of the fantail  hence it must be assumed  not only that half civilized man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species  but that he intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species  and further  that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown  so many strange contingencies are improbable in the highest degree some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration  the rock pigeon is of a slaty blue  with white loins but the indian sub species  c  intermedia of strickland  has this part bluish  the tail has a terminal dark bar  with the outer feathers externally edged at the base with white  the wings have two black bars some semi domestic breeds  and some truly wild breeds  have  besides the two black bars  the wings chequered with black  these several marks do not occur together in any other species of the whole family  now  in every one of the domestic breeds  taking thoroughly well bred birds  all the above marks  even to the white edging of the outer tail feathers sometimes concur perfectly developed  moreover  when birds belonging to two or more distinct breeds are crossed  none of which are blue or have any of the above specified marks  the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to acquire these characters  to give one instance out of several which i have observed: i crossed some white fantails  which breed very true  with some black barbs  and it so happens that blue varieties of barbs are so rare that i never heard of an instance in england  and the mongrels were black  brown and mottled  i also crossed a barb with a spot  which is a white bird with a red tail and red spot on the forehead  and which notoriously breeds very true  the mongrels were dusky and mottled  i then crossed one of the mongrel barb fantails with a mongrel barb spot  and they produced a bird of as beautiful a blue colour  with the white loins  double black wing bar  and barred and white edged tail feathers  as any wild rock pigeon! we can understand these facts  on the well known principle of reversion to ancestral characters  if all the domestic breeds are descended from the rock pigeon  but if we deny this  we must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions  either  first  that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like the rock pigeon  although no other existing species is thus coloured and marked  so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings  or  secondly  that each breed  even the purest  has within a dozen  or at most within a score of generations  been crossed by the rock pigeon: i say within a dozen or twenty generations  for no instance is known of crossed descendants reverting to an ancestor of foreign blood  removed by a greater number of generations  in a breed which has been crossed only once the tendency to revert to any character derived from such a cross will naturally become less and less  as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign blood  but when there has been no cross  and there is a tendency in the breed to revert to a character which was lost during some former generation  this tendency  for all that we can see to the contrary  may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations  these two distinct cases of reversion are often confounded together by those who have written on inheritance lastly  the hybrids or mongrels from between all the breeds of the pigeon are perfectly fertile  as i can state from my own observations purposely made  on the most distinct breeds  now  hardly any cases have been ascertained with certainty of hybrids from two quite distinct species of animals being perfectly fertile  some authors believe that long continued domestication eliminates this strong tendency to sterility in species  from the history of the dog  and of some other domestic animals  this conclusion is probably quite correct  if applied to species closely related to each other  but to extend it so far as to suppose that species  aboriginally as distinct as carriers  tumblers pouters  and fantails now are  should yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se  seems to me rash in the extreme from these several reasons  namely  the improbability of man having formerly made seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freely under domestication  these supposed species being quite unknown in a wild state  and their not having become anywhere feral  these species presenting certain very abnormal characters  as compared with all other columbidae  though so like the rock pigeon in most other respects  the occasional reappearance of the blue colour and various black marks in all the breeds  both when kept pure and when crossed  and lastly  the mongrel offspring being perfectly fertile  from these several reasons taken together  we may safely conclude that all our domestic breeds are descended from the rock pigeon or columba livia with its geographical sub species in favour of this view  i may add  firstly  that the wild c  livia has been found capable of domestication in europe and in india  and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds  secondly  that although an english carrier or a short faced tumbler differs immensely in certain characters from the rock pigeon  yet that by comparing the several sub breeds of these two races  more especially those brought from distant countries  we can make  between them and the rock pigeon  an almost perfect series  so we can in some other cases  but not with all the breeds  thirdly those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed are in each eminently variable  for instance  the wattle and length of beak of the carrier  the shortness of that of the tumbler  and the number of tail feathers in the fantail  and the explanation of this fact will be obvious when we treat of selection  fourthly  pigeons have been watched and tended with the utmost care  and loved by many people  they have been domesticated for thousands of years in several quarters of the world  the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth aegyptian dynasty  about 3000 b c   as was pointed out to me by professor lepsius but mr  birch informs me that pigeons are given in a bill of fare in the previous dynasty  in the time of the romans  as we hear from pliny immense prices were given for pigeons   nay  they are come to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race   pigeons were much valued by akber khan in india  about the year 1600  never less than 20 000 pigeons were taken with the court   the monarchs of iran and turan sent him some very rare birds   and  continues the courtly historian   his majesty  by crossing the breeds  which method was never practised before  has improved them astonishingly   about this same period the dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old romans  the paramount importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone  will likewise be obvious when we treat of selection  we shall then  also  see how it is that the several breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character it is also a most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds  that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life  and thus different breeds can be kept together in the same aviary i have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some yet quite insufficient  length  because when i first kept pigeons and watched the several kinds  well knowing how truly they breed  i felt fully as much difficulty in believing that since they had been domesticated they had all proceeded from a common parent  as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard to the many species of finches  or other groups of birds  in nature  one circumstance has struck me much  namely  that nearly all the breeders of the various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants  with whom i have conversed  or whose treatises i have read  are firmly convinced that the several breeds to which each has attended  are descended from so many aboriginally distinct species  ask  as i have asked  a celebrated raiser of hereford cattle  whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns  or both from a common parent stock  and he will laugh you to scorn  i have never met a pigeon  or poultry  or duck or rabbit fancier  who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a distinct species  van mons  in his treatise on pears and apples  shows how utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts for instance a ribston pippin or codlin apple  could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree  innumerable other examples could be given  the explanation  i think  is simple: from long continued study they are strongly impressed with the differences between the several races  and though they well know that each race varies slightly  for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences  yet they ignore all general arguments  and refuse to sum up in their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive generations  may not those naturalists who  knowing far less of the laws of inheritance than does the breeder  and knowing no more than he does of the intermediate links in the long lines of descent  yet admit that many of our domestic races are descended from the same parents  may they not learn a lesson of caution  when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature being lineal descendants of other species? principles of selection anciently followed  and their effects let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have been produced  either from one or from several allied species  some effect may be attributed to the direct and definite action of the external conditions of life  and some to habit  but he would be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences between a dray and race horse  a greyhound and bloodhound  a carrier and tumbler pigeon one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that we see in them adaptation  not indeed to the animal s or plant s own good but to man s use or fancy  some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly  or by one step  many botanists  for instance  believe that the fuller s teasel  with its hooks  which can not be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance  is only a variety of the wild dipsacus  and this amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling  so it has probably been with the turnspit dog  and this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep  but when we compare the dray horse and race horse  the dromedary and camel  the various breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture  with the wool of one breed good for one purpose  and that of another breed for another purpose  when we compare the many breeds of dogs  each good for man in different ways  when we compare the game cock  so pertinacious in battle  with other breeds so little quarrelsome  with  everlasting layers  which never desire to sit  and with the bantam so small and elegant  when we compare the host of agricultural  culinary  orchard and flower garden races of plants  most useful to man at different seasons and for different purposes  or so beautiful in his eyes  we must  i think  look further than to mere variability  we can not suppose that all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them  indeed  in many cases  we know that this has not been their history  the key is man s power of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations  man adds them up in certain directions useful to him  in this sense he may be said to have made for himself useful breeds the great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical it is certain that several of our eminent breeders have  even within a single lifetime  modified to a large extent their breeds of cattle and sheep  in order fully to realise what they have done it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject and to inspect the animals  breeders habitually speak of an animal s organisation as something plastic  which they can model almost as they please  if i had space i could quote numerous passages to this effect from highly competent authorities  youatt  who was probably better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other individual  and who was himself a very good judge of animals  speaks of the principle of selection as  that which enables the agriculturist  not only to modify the character of his flock  but to change it altogether it is the magician s wand  by means of which he may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases   lord somerville  speaking of what breeders have done for sheep  says:  it would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect in itself  and then had given it existence   in saxony the importance of the principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised  that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are studied  like a picture by a connoisseur  this is done three times at intervals of months  and the sheep are each time marked and classed  so that the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding what english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices given for animals with a good pedigree  and these have been exported to almost every quarter of the world  the improvement is by no means generally due to crossing different breeds  all the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice  except sometimes among closely allied sub breeds  and when a cross has been made  the closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases  if selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breeding from it  the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth notice  but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the accumulation in one direction  during successive generations  of differences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye  differences which i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate  not one man in a thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder  if gifted with these qualities  and he studies his subject for years  and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance  he will succeed  and may make great improvements  if he wants any of these qualities  he will assuredly fail  few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon fancier the same principles are followed by horticulturists  but the variations are here often more abrupt  no one supposes that our choicest productions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock  we have proofs that this is not so in several cases in which exact records have been kept  thus  to give a very trifling instance the steadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted we see an astonishing improvement in many florists  flowers  when the flowers of the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago  when a race of plants is once pretty well established  the seed raisers do not pick out the best plants  but merely go over their seed beds  and pull up the  rogues   as they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard  with animals this kind of selection is  in fact  likewise followed  for hardly any one is so careless as to breed from his worst animals in regard to plants  there is another means of observing the accumulated effects of selection  namely  by comparing the diversity of flowers in the different varieties of the same species in the flower garden  the diversity of leaves  pods  or tubers  or whatever part is valued  in the kitchen garden  in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard  in comparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties  see how different the leaves of the cabbage are  and how extremely alike the flowers  how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are  and how alike the leaves  how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size  colour  shape  and hairiness  and yet the flowers present very slight differences  it is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not differ at all in other points  this is hardly ever  i speak after careful observation  perhaps never  the case  the law of correlated variation  the importance of which should never be overlooked  will ensure some differences  but  as a general rule  it cannot be doubted that the continued selection of slight variations either in the leaves  the flowers  or the fruit  will produce races differing from each other chiefly in these characters it may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to methodical practice for scarcely more than three quarters of a century it has certainly been more attended to of late years  and many treatises have been published on the subject  and the result has been  in a corresponding degree  rapid and important  but it is very far from true that the principle is a modern discovery  i could give several references to works of high antiquity  in which the full importance of the principle is acknowledged  in rude and barbarous periods of english history choice animals were often imported  and laws were passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a certain size was ordered  and this may be compared to the  roguing  of plants by nurserymen  the principle of selection i find distinctly given in an ancient chinese encyclopaedia  explicit rules are laid down by some of the roman classical writers  from passages in genesis  it is clear that the colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals  to improve the breed  and they formerly did so  as is attested by passages in pliny  the savages in south africa match their draught cattle by colour  as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs  livingstone states that good domestic breeds are highly valued by the negroes in the interior of africa who have not associated with europeans  some of these facts do not show actual selection  but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times  and is now attended to by the lowest savages  it would  indeed  have been a strange fact  had attention not been paid to breeding  for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious unconscious selection at the present time  eminent breeders try by methodical selection  with a distinct object in view  to make a new strain or sub breed  superior to anything of the kind in the country  but  for our purpose  a form of selection  which may be called unconscious  and which results from every one trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals  is more important  thus  a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he can  and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs  but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering the breed  nevertheless we may infer that this process  continued during centuries  would improve and modify any breed  in the same way as bakewell  collins  etc   by this very same process  only carried on more methodically  did greatly modify  even during their lifetimes  the forms and qualities of their cattle  slow and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question have been made long ago  which may serve for comparison  in some cases  however  unchanged  or but little changed individuals of the same breed exist in less civilised districts  where the breed has been less improved  there is reason to believe that king charles  spaniel has been unconsciously modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch  some highly competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from the spaniel  and has probably been slowly altered from it  it is known that the english pointer has been greatly changed within the last century  and in this case the change has  it is believed  been chiefly effected by crosses with the foxhound  but what concerns us is  that the change has been effected unconsciously and gradually  and yet so effectually that though the old spanish pointer certainly came from spain  mr  borrow has not seen  as i am informed by him  any native dog in spain like our pointer by a similar process of selection  and by careful training  english race horses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent arabs so that the latter  by the regulations for the goodwood races  are favoured in the weights which they carry  lord spencer and others have shown how the cattle of england have increased in weight and in early maturity  compared with the stock formerly kept in this country  by comparing the accounts given in various old treatises of the former and present state of carrier and tumbler pigeons in britain  india and persia  we can trace the stages through which they have insensibly passed  and come to differ so greatly from the rock pigeon youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of selection which may be considered as unconscious  in so far that the breeders could never have expected  or even wished  to produce the result which ensued  namely  the production of the distinct strains  the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr  buckley and mr  burgess  as mr  youatt remarks   have been purely bred from the original stock of mr  bakewell for upwards of fifty years  there is not a suspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of mr  bakewell s flock  and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited character of the offspring of their domestic animals  yet any one animal particularly useful to them  for any special purpose  would be carefully preserved during famines and other accidents  to which savages are so liable  and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring than the inferior ones  so that in this case there would be a kind of unconscious selection going on  we see the value set on animals even by the barbarians of tierra del fuego  by their killing and devouring their old women  in times of dearth  as of less value than their dogs in plants the same gradual process of improvement through the occasional preservation of the best individuals  whether or not sufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinct varieties and whether or not two or more species or races have become blended together by crossing  may plainly be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease  rose pelargonium  dahlia  and other plants  when compared with the older varieties or with their parent stocks  no one would ever expect to get a first rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant  no one would expect to raise a first rate melting pear from the seed of a wild pear  though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild  if it had come from a garden stock  the pear  though cultivated in classical times  appears  from pliny s description  to have been a fruit of very inferior quality  i have seen great surprise expressed in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in having produced such splendid results from such poor materials  but the art has been simple and  as far as the final result is concerned  has been followed almost unconsciously  it has consisted in always cultivating the best known variety  sowing its seeds  and  when a slightly better variety chanced to appear  selecting it  and so onwards  but the gardeners of the classical period  who cultivated the best pears which they could procure  never thought what splendid fruit we should eat  though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find a large amount of change  thus slowly and unconsciously accumulated explains  as i believe  the well known fact  that in a number of cases we cannot recognise  and therefore do not know  the wild parent stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens  if it has taken centuries or thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to man  we can understand how it is that neither australia the cape of good hope  nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man  has afforded us a single plant worth culture  it is not that these countries  so rich in species  do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants  but that the native plants have not been improved by continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that acquired by the plants in countries anciently civilised in regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man  it should not be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food  at least during certain seasons  and in two countries very differently circumstanced  individuals of the same species  having slightly different constitutions or structure  would often succeed better in the one country than in the other  and thus by a process of  natural selection   as will hereafter be more fully explained  two sub breeds might be formed  this  perhaps  partly explains why the varieties kept by savages  as has been remarked by some authors have more of the character of true species than the varieties kept in civilised countries on the view here given of the important part which selection by man has played  it becomes at once obvious  how it is that our domestic races show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man s wants or fancies  we can  i think  further understand the frequently abnormal character of our domestic races  and likewise their differences being so great in external characters  and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs  man can hardly select  or only with much difficulty  any deviation of structure excepting such as is externally visible  and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal  he can never act by selection  excepting on variations which are first given to him in some slight degree by nature  no man would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner  or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual size  and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first appeared  the more likely it would be to catch his attention  but to use such an expression as trying to make a fantail is  i have no doubt  in most cases  utterly incorrect  the man who first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail  never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon would become through long continued  partly unconscious and partly methodical  selection  perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only fourteen tail feathers somewhat expanded  like the present java fantail  or like individuals of other and distinct breeds  in which as many as seventeen tail feathers have been counted  perhaps the first pouter pigeon did not inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus  a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers  as it is not one of the points of the breed nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be necessary to catch the fancier s eye: he perceives extremely small differences  and it is in human nature to value any novelty  however slight  in one s own possession  nor must the value which would formerly have been set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species  be judged of by the value which is now set on them  after several breeds have fairly been established  it is known that with pigeons many slight variations now occasionally appear  but these are rejected as faults or deviations from the standard of perfection in each breed  the common goose has not given rise to any marked varieties hence the toulouse and the common breed  which differ only in colour that most fleeting of characters  have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry shows these views appear to explain what has sometimes been noticed  namely that we know hardly anything about the origin or history of any of our domestic breeds  but  in fact  a breed  like a dialect of a language can hardly be said to have a distinct origin  a man preserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation of structure  or takes more care than usual in matching his best animals  and thus improves them  and the improved animals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood  but they will as yet hardly have a distinct name and from being only slightly valued  their history will have been disregarded  when further improved by the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely  and will be recognised as something distinct and valuable  and will then probably first receive a provincial name  in semi civilised countries  with little free communication  the spreading of a new sub breed will be a slow process  as soon as the points of value are once acknowledged  the principle  as i have called it  of unconscious selection will always tend  perhaps more at one period than at another  as the breed rises or falls in fashion  perhaps more in one district than in another  according to the state of civilization of the inhabitants  slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed  whatever they may be  but the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved of such slow varying  and insensible changes circumstances favourable to man s power of selection i will now say a few words on the circumstances  favourable or the reverse  to man s power of selection  a high degree of variability is obviously favourable  as freely giving the materials for selection to work on  not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient with extreme care  to allow of the accumulation of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction  but as variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally  the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of individuals being kept  hence number is of the highest importance for success  on this principle marshall formerly remarked  with respect to the sheep of part of yorkshire   as they generally belong to poor people  and are mostly in small lots  they never can be improved   on the other hand  nurserymen  from keeping large stocks of the same plant are generally far more successful than amateurs in raising new and valuable varieties  a large number of individuals of an animal or plant can be reared only where the conditions for its propagation are favourable  when the individuals are scanty all will be allowed to breed  whatever their quality may be  and this will effectually prevent selection  but probably the most important element is that the animal or plant should be so highly valued by man  that the closest attention is paid to even the slightest deviations in its qualities or structure unless such attention be paid nothing can be effected  i have seen it gravely remarked  that it was most fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to attend to this plant  no doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was cultivated  but the slight varieties had been neglected  as soon  however  as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly larger  earlier  or better fruit  and raised seedlings from them  and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them  then  with some aid by crossing distinct species those many admirable varieties of the strawberry were raised which have appeared during the last half century with animals  facility in preventing crosses is an important element in the formation of new races  at least  in a country which is already stocked with other races  in this respect enclosure of the land plays a part  wandering savages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species  pigeons can be mated for life and this is a great convenience to the fancier  for thus many races may be improved and kept true  though mingled in the same aviary  and this circumstance must have largely favoured the formation of new breeds pigeons  i may add  can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate  and inferior birds may be freely rejected  as when killed they serve for food  on the other hand  cats  from their nocturnal rambling habits  can not be easily matched  and  although so much valued by women and children  we rarely see a distinct breed long kept up  such breeds as we do sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country  although i do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than others  yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat the donkey  peacock  goose  etc   may be attributed in main part to selection not having been brought into play: in cats  from the difficulty in pairing them  in donkeys  from only a few being kept by poor people  and little attention paid to their breeding  for recently in certain parts of spain and of the united states this animal has been surprisingly modified and improved by careful selection  in peacocks from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept  in geese from being valuable only for two purposes  food and feathers  and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinct breeds  but the goose  under the conditions to which it is exposed when domesticated  seems to have a singularly inflexible organisation  though it has varied to a slight extent  as i have elsewhere described some authors have maintained that the amount of variation in our domestic productions is soon reached  and can never afterward be exceeded  it would be somewhat rash to assert that the limit has been attained in any one case  for almost all our animals and plants have been greatly improved in many ways within a recent period  and this implies variation  it would be equally rash to assert that characters now increased to their utmost limit  could not  after remaining fixed for many centuries  again vary under new conditions of life  no doubt as mr  wallace has remarked with much truth  a limit will be at last reached  for instance  there must be a limit to the fleetness of any terrestrial animal  as this will be determined by the friction to be overcome  the weight of the body to be carried  and the power of contraction in the muscular fibres  but what concerns us is that the domestic varieties of the same species differ from each other in almost every character  which man has attended to and selected  more than do the distinct species of the same genera  isidore geoffroy st  hilaire has proved this in regard to size  and so it is with colour  and probably with the length of hair  with respect to fleetness  which depends on many bodily characters  eclipse was far fleeter  and a dray horse is comparably stronger  than any two natural species belonging to the same genus  so with plants  the seeds of the different varieties of the bean or maize probably differ more in size than do the seeds of the distinct species in any one genus in the same two families the same remark holds good in regard to the fruit of the several varieties of the plum  and still more strongly with the melon  as well as in many other analogous cases to sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants changed conditions of life are of the highest importance in causing variability  both by acting directly on the organisation  and indirectly by affecting the reproductive system  it is not probable that variability is an inherent and necessary contingent  under all circumstances  the greater or less force of inheritance and reversion determine whether variations shall endure  variability is governed by many unknown laws  of which correlated growth is probably the most important  something  but how much we do not know  may be attributed to the definite action of the conditions of life  some  perhaps a great effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of parts  the final result is thus rendered infinitely complex  in some cases the intercrossing of aboriginally distinct species appears to have played an important part in the origin of our breeds  when several breeds have once been formed in any country  their occasional intercrossing  with the aid of selection  has  no doubt  largely aided in the formation of new sub breeds  but the importance of crossing has been much exaggerated  both in regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed  with plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings  buds  etc   the importance of crossing is immense  for the cultivator may here disregard the extreme variability both of hybrids and of mongrels  and the sterility of hybrids  but plants not propagated by seed are of little importance to us  for their endurance is only temporary  over all these causes of change  the accumulative action of selection  whether applied methodically and quickly  or unconsciously and slowly  but more efficiently  seems to have been the predominant power chapter ii  variation under nature  variability  individual differences  doubtful species  wide ranging  much diffused  and common species  vary most  species of the larger  genera in each country vary more frequently than the species of the  smaller genera  many of the species of the larger genera resemble  varieties in being very closely  but unequally  related to each other  and in having restricted ranges before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organic beings in a state of nature  we must briefly discuss whether these latter are subject to any variation  to treat this subject properly  a long catalogue of dry facts ought to be given  but these i shall reserve for a future work  nor shall i here discuss the various definitions which have been given of the term species  no one definition has satisfied all naturalists  yet every naturalist knows vaguely what he means when he speaks of a species  generally the term includes the unknown element of a distinct act of creation  the term  variety  is almost equally difficult to define  but here community of descent is almost universally implied  though it can rarely be proved  we have also what are called monstrosities  but they graduate into varieties  by a monstrosity i presume is meant some considerable deviation of structure generally injurious  or not useful to the species  some authors use the term  variation  in a technical sense  as implying a modification directly due to the physical conditions of life  and  variations  in this sense are supposed not to be inherited  but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells in the brackish waters of the baltic  or dwarfed plants on alpine summits  or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards  would not in some cases be inherited for at least a few generations? and in this case i presume that the form would be called a variety it may be doubted whether sudden and considerable deviations of structure  such as we occasionally see in our domestic productions  more especially with plants  are ever permanently propagated in a state of nature  almost every part of every organic being is so beautifully related to its complex conditions of life that it seems as improbable that any part should have been suddenly produced perfect  as that a complex machine should have been invented by man in a perfect state under domestication monstrosities sometimes occur which resemble normal structures in widely different animals  thus pigs have occasionally been born with a sort of proboscis  and if any wild species of the same genus had naturally possessed a proboscis  it might have been argued that this had appeared as a monstrosity  but i have as yet failed to find  after diligent search  cases of monstrosities resembling normal structures in nearly allied forms  and these alone bear on the question  if monstrous forms of this kind ever do appear in a state of nature and are capable of reproduction  which is not always the case   as they occur rarely and singly  their preservation would depend on unusually favourable circumstances  they would  also  during the first and succeeding generations cross with the ordinary form  and thus their abnormal character would almost inevitably be lost  but i shall have to return in a future chapter to the preservation and perpetuation of single or occasional variations individual differences the many slight differences which appear in the offspring from the same parents  or which it may be presumed have thus arisen  from being observed in the individuals of the same species inhabiting the same confined locality  may be called individual differences  no one supposes that all the individuals of the same species are cast in the same actual mould  these individual differences are of the highest importance for us  for they are often inherited  as must be familiar to every one and they thus afford materials for natural selection to act on and accumulate  in the same manner as man accumulates in any given direction individual differences in his domesticated productions  these individual differences generally affect what naturalists consider unimportant parts  but i could show  by a long catalogue of facts  that parts which must be called important  whether viewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view  sometimes vary in the individuals of the same species  i am convinced that the most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the cases of variability  even in important parts of structure  which he could collect on good authority as i have collected  during a course of years  it should be remembered that systematists are far from being pleased at finding variability in important characters  and that there are not many men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs  and compare them in many specimens of the same species  it would never have been expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the great central ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the same species it might have been thought that changes of this nature could have been effected only by slow degrees  yet sir j  lubbock has shown a degree of variability in these main nerves in coccus  which may almost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree  this philosophical naturalist  i may add  has also shown that the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are far from uniform  authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state that important organs never vary  for these same authors practically rank those parts as important  as some few naturalists have honestly confessed  which do not vary  and  under this point of view  no instance will ever be found of an important part varying  but under any other point of view many instances assuredly can be given there is one point connected with individual differences which is extremely perplexing: i refer to those genera which have been called  protean  or  polymorphic   in which species present an inordinate amount of variation  with respect to many of these forms  hardly two naturalists agree whether to rank them as species or as varieties  we may instance rubus  rosa  and hieracium among plants  several genera of insects  and of brachiopod shells  in most polymorphic genera some of the species have fixed and definite characters  genera which are polymorphic in one country seem to be  with a few exceptions polymorphic in other countries  and likewise  judging from brachiopod shells  at former periods of time  these facts are very perplexing  for they seem to show that this kind of variability is independent of the conditions of life  i am inclined to suspect that we see  at least in some of these polymorphic genera  variations which are of no service or disservice to the species  and which consequently have not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection  as hereafter to be explained individuals of the same species often present  as is known to every one great differences of structure  independently of variation  as in the two sexes of various animals  in the two or three castes of sterile females or workers among insects  and in the immature and larval states of many of the lower animals  there are  also  cases of dimorphism and trimorphism  both with animals and plants  thus  mr  wallace  who has lately called attention to the subject  has shown that the females of certain species of butterflies  in the malayan archipelago  regularly appear under two or even three conspicuously distinct forms  not connected by intermediate varieties  fritz muller has described analogous but more extraordinary cases with the males of certain brazilian crustaceans: thus  the male of a tanais regularly occurs under two distinct forms  one of these has strong and differently shaped pincers  and the other has antennae much more abundantly furnished with smelling hairs  although in most of these cases  the two or three forms both with animals and plants  are not now connected by intermediate gradations  it is possible that they were once thus connected  mr wallace  for instance  describes a certain butterfly which presents in the same island a great range of varieties connected by intermediate links  and the extreme links of the chain closely resemble the two forms of an allied dimorphic species inhabiting another part of the malay archipelago  thus also with ants  the several worker castes are generally quite distinct  but in some cases  as we shall hereafter see the castes are connected together by finely graduated varieties  so it is  as i have myself observed  with some dimorphic plants  it certainly at first appears a highly remarkable fact that the same female butterfly should have the power of producing at the same time three distinct female forms and a male  and that an hermaphrodite plant should produce from the same seed capsule three distinct hermaphrodite forms  bearing three different kinds of females and three or even six different kinds of males  nevertheless these cases are only exaggerations of the common fact that the female produces offspring of two sexes which sometimes differ from each other in a wonderful manner doubtful species the forms which possess in some considerable degree the character of species  but which are so closely similar to other forms  or are so closely linked to them by intermediate gradations  that naturalists do not like to rank them as distinct species  are in several respects the most important for us  we have every reason to believe that many of these doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained their characters for a long time  for as long  as far as we know  as have good and true species  practically  when a naturalist can unite by means of intermediate links any two forms  he treats the one as a variety of the other  ranking the most common  but sometimes the one first described as the species  and the other as the variety  but cases of great difficulty  which i will not here enumerate  sometimes arise in deciding whether or not to rank one form as a variety of another  even when they are closely connected by intermediate links  nor will the commonly assumed hybrid nature of the intermediate forms always remove the difficulty  in very many cases  however  one form is ranked as a variety of another  not because the intermediate links have actually been found but because analogy leads the observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist  or may formerly have existed  and here a wide door for the entry of doubt and conjecture is opened hence  in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety  the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wide experience seems the only guide to follow  we must  however  in many cases  decide by a majority of naturalists  for few well marked and well known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as species by at least some competent judges that varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot be disputed  compare the several floras of great britain  of france  or of the united states  drawn up by different botanists  and see what a surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as good species  and by another as mere varieties  mr  h c  watson  to whom i lie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds  has marked for me 182 british plants  which are generally considered as varieties  but which have all been ranked by botanists as species  and in making this list he has omitted many trifling varieties  but which nevertheless have been ranked by some botanists as species  and he has entirely omitted several highly polymorphic genera  under genera  including the most polymorphic forms  mr  babington gives 251 species  whereas mr  bentham gives only 112  a difference of 139 doubtful forms! among animals which unite for each birth  and which are highly locomotive  doubtful forms ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety  can rarely be found within the same country  but are common in separated areas  how many of the birds and insects in north america and europe which differ very slightly from each other  have been ranked by one eminent naturalist as undoubted species  and by another as varieties or  as they are often called  geographical races! mr  wallace  in several valuable papers on the various animals  especially on the lepidoptera  inhabiting the islands of the great malayan archipelago shows that they may be classed under four heads  namely  as variable forms  as local forms  as geographical races or sub species  and as true representative species  the first or variable forms vary much within the limits of the same island  the local forms are moderately constant and distinct in each separate island  but when all from the several islands are compared together  the differences are seen to be so slight and graduated that it is impossible to define or describe them  though at the same time the extreme forms are sufficiently distinct  the geographical races or sub species are local forms completely fixed and isolated  but as they do not differ from each other by strongly marked and important characters   there is no possible test but individual opinion to determine which of them shall be considered as species and which as varieties   lastly  representative species fill the same place in the natural economy of each island as do the local forms and sub species  but as they are distinguished from each other by a greater amount of difference than that between the local forms and sub species they are almost universally ranked by naturalists as true species nevertheless  no certain criterion can possibly be given by which variable forms  local forms  sub species and representative species can be recognised many years ago  when comparing  and seeing others compare  the birds from the closely neighbouring islands of the galapagos archipelago one with another  and with those from the american mainland  i was much struck how entirely vague and arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties  on the islets of the little madeira group there are many insects which are characterized as varieties in mr  wollaston s admirable work  but which would certainly be ranked as distinct species by many entomologists  even ireland has a few animals  now generally regarded as varieties  but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists  several experienced ornithologists consider our british red grouse as only a strongly marked race of a norwegian
